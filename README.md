# NHentaiDownloader
A chrome extension to download doujinshi from NHentai

<hr/>

### Update 06/12/2020: Chrome decided to delete my extension from their store, if you still want to use it, please follow the steps below
### For the most recent version, you can download it from the [release page](https://github.com/Xwilarg/NHentaiDownloader/releases)
### For more information on how to install it, scroll at the end of this README

<hr/>

NHentai only allow to download doujinshi in .torrent format so I created this extension allowing to download them either in ZIP, CBZ or raw format.<br/>
You can either go on a doujinshi page to download it, or go to a page containing many of them to download them all at once.
